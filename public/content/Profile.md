## About
Hi, I’m Ryan, a senior studying Computer Engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. My academic journey has immersed me in both software development and embedded systems, and I’ve developed a passion for working at the intersection of these fields. From building applications to designing embedded systems, I thrive on solving complex problems with innovative solutions.

I’m always eager to take on new challenges and explore opportunities that push me to grow—whether that’s developing efficient software, working on hardware integration, or something entirely new. My goal is to contribute to projects that make an impact, while continuously expanding my skills across the tech spectrum.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy living in California and am an avid sports fan. You can often find me playing or watching sports in my free time.
